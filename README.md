A repository of JS scripts for automating things on Chrome using the "Custom JavaScript for Websites 2" extension. Download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdk?hl=en).

The code in each of the .js files can be copied and pasted in the editor window of the extension. Most of the code is dependent on jQuery so you might have to add an external script or select jQuery 3.x.x as shown here:

## ðŸš¨ Warning ðŸš¨: Using custom scripts in browsers from third parties in sites that contain your personal data is extremely dangerous and do it at your own risk. Read and understand the code before pasting it in the browser.
